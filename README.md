3. contracts

1. Basic NFT
1. RANDOM IPFS NFT

- Pros: cheap
- Cons: someone needs to pin our data (even it's decentralized)

3. Dynamic SVG (100% on chain, image of it's going to change based of some parameters.) NFT

- Pros: data on chain
- Cons: much more expensive!!

Make it dynamic: If price of ETH is above X -> Happy face, if it's below -> Sad Face
